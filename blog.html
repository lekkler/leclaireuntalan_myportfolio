          <h2 class="term-title">PRELIMINARY PERIOD</h2>
          <p>During my prelims, I learned about the fundamental concepts of database systems, starting with data models that provide structured representations of real-world data through entities, attributes, and relationships.</p>
          <p>During the prelims, I learned the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. HTML taught me how to structure web content using tags for text, links, images, and forms. I discovered how to organize information with lists, tables, and proper document layout. CSS showed me how to style these elements by changing colors, fonts, spacing, and backgrounds. I practiced connecting CSS to HTML through internal and external styling methods. The lessons emphasized how HTML defines content while CSS controls its appearance, working together to create functional and visually appealing web pages. These fundamentals prepared me for more advanced web development topics in the coming terms.</p>

          <h2 class="term-title">MIDTERM PERIOD</h2>
          <p>In the midterm, I learned responsive web design using CSS Grid and media queries to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. I also studied JavaScript basics, including variables, operators, loops, and conditional statements to add interactivity to websites. The module covered how to make images and videos responsive and introduced JavaScript functions for dynamic web content.</p>

          <h2 class="term-title">PRE-FINAL PERIOD</h2>
          <p>In the pre-final,  I learned about JavaScript functions and error handling. Functions help organize code into reusable blocks, using parameters to pass data and return to output results. I practiced declaring functions, calling them, and using local/global variables. JavaScript functions for reusable code and error handling using try-catch. The module covered common errors (SyntaxError, TypeError) and debugging techniques like console.log() and breakpoints to troubleshoot code effectively.</p>

          <h2 class="term-title">FINAL PERIOD </h2>
          <p>The finals brought everything together Web Programming. This required integrating all the knowledge and skills gained throughout the semester into a cohesive strategy.</p>
          <p>In the final term, I was introduced to ASP.NET, Microsoft's framework for building dynamic web applications. The module covered .NET platform fundamentals, ASP.NET architecture (Web Forms, MVC, Web Pages), and ASP.NET Core's cross-platform capabilities. I learned about key components like Program.cs configuration, middleware, dependency injection, and error handling techniques. The course highlighted ASP.NET's advantages including Web APIs, real-time communication with SignalR, and cloud-ready application development using C# programming language.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Looking back on the entire semester, I can see tremendous growth in both my knowledge and skills. The progressive structure of the course allowed me to build competence step by step, culminating in the ability to create and execute complete strategies.</p>
        <p>Throughout this course on Web Programming Essentials, I gained a solid foundation in building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Starting with HTML, I learned to structure web content using semantic tags, forms, tables, and multimedia elements. CSS taught me how to style pages with layouts, grids, and responsive design techniques like media queries. JavaScript introduced me to programming concepts—variables, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation—to create interactive web experiences.

The course also covered error handling and debugging, helping me troubleshoot code effectively. Finally, ASP.NET expanded my understanding of server-side development, including MVC architecture and .NET Core’s cross-platform capabilities.

Key Insight: Web development is a blend of creativity and logic. Mastering these core technologies allows me to build functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly websites—an essential skill in today’s digital world.</p>
